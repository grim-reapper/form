    return "<input type='$type' name='$name' value='$value' $attr_string>";
});
```

You can then use the registered custom type by using the `custom()` method and passing in the name of the custom type
and an array of parameters to be passed to the callback function

```php
echo Form::custom('custom_input', ['text', 'first_name', 'John']);
```
